# SeaJobs: A Service Bidding Platform

## Program Overview

Because of our limited knowledge in web development and React, we decided to use C++ and create a functional prototype and a proof of concept in the terminal.

We decided pursue the third track, **Small Biz, Big Impact**:
    Small businesses are the heart of any community, but they often face big challenges. This track is all about building creative, impactful solutions that empower local businesses–whether it’s making operations smoother, boosting visibility, or fostering collaboration. How can technology help small businesses thrive? The possibilities are endless, and it’s up to you to bring them to life!


## Project Motivation
- Create a space where we can benefit the person requesting a service, as well as the business that offers the service.
- Benefit small business labor rather than corporate giants or union labor. Drive business, build clientele, market business. 
- Directly benefit the person requesting service with the bidding option. This lowers prices by offering competition.

## Functionality
- User can be a service provider, or a service requester.
- Service provider's place competitive bets, driving compitition that directly translates to competitive savings for service requestor
- Service requestor supports small and local business's. SeaJobs platform offers recognition and promotion to top reviewed companies

# Running program

Function contains 3 classes related to each other in a somewhat relational model.

Main.cpp simply creates a current instance for the user, similar to logging into a computer. Next, it prints the menu and allows the current user to view and modify the live market, depending on whether they are a person requesting service, or a company offering a service.
